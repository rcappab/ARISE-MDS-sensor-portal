# Deployment

A deployment refers to the placement of a monitoring device (such as a camera trap or audio recorder) at a specific location and time. It includes metadata such as device ID, geographic coordinates, installation settings, and duration. Deployments are linked to one or more projects and form the basis for data collection in the field.
